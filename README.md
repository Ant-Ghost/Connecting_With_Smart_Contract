### Connect and Execute

Here I connect to the MetaMask account and try to execute an transaction on a local network.

git repo used: https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-simple-storage.git

This project failed to execute but you can understand how your frontend/backend code is connected to a smart contract.

```
npm i
```

```
npm run get-hardhat
```

```
npm run get-libs
```

Now you need two terminals. One to run the hardhat vm to execute the smart contract. Another to host your frontend.

1.

```
npm run start-vm
```

2.

```
npm run http-server
```
